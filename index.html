            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Have you ever looked at a website and wondered how it works? All the buttons that you could click and the motions in your favorite website are a part of the front end development. Basically, all the visible site features are built through front end development.</p>
            <p>The backend is the part of a web application that is unrevealed to the user. Unlike front-end, back-end development operations are not very easy and usually turn out to be complicated and manifold; this part is in alignment with the server. Backend operations are a lot different that are controlled by different programming languages like NodeJS.</p>
